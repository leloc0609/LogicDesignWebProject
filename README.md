# LogicDesignWebProject 
## I.*Introduction*:
Nowadays,MIPS has become an powerful language that support the student to interact with Computer Architecture.
Therefore,we have made an website in order to help students understanding deeper about this subject.
## II.*Preview the project* : <br/>
There are 2 ways to see our project:<br />
### Preview online without technical installation
We have hosted it online by using the hosting page [000webhost](https://vn.000webhost.com/).<br/>
<img src= "Pictures/Webpage.png" height = "300"> <br/>
### Preview offline: <br/>
> Making sure that your computer have PHP, JS and C++ environment. <br />
>
First, you need to download the [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) which can create the virtual host. <br />
After that, you can watch this video : [HOW TO USE XAMPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H29Z8ZLw6I) to execute our project. <br />

## III.*What technologies this website use*:
### Frontend:
In this part,we have used HTML,CSS and Javascript to code the frontend.<br />
### Backend:
We have used C++ to code the backend file and PHP to make iteraction between frontend and database. <br />
### Virtual host: 
 XAMPP can be helpful <br />

##  IV.*Functions*:
There are 3 main functions you can make use of :<br />
First, user can track down and see the list of books which we have prepared for studing and external research.<br />
Secondly, user can choose the [**MIPS Single-cycle Datapath Visualizer**](https://mips4everyone.000webhostapp.com/datapath-visualizer) which can help the users visualize better how it actually works and 
Thirdly, user can choose the [**MIPS Simulator**](https://mips4everyone.000webhostapp.com/simulator)

>There are also videos we have made so that can help you easier going through our website <br /> 

>Because we don't have much experience in using PHP to communicate with backend storage so that we have put those HTML into PHP files which can cause difficult for future updates. <br />
